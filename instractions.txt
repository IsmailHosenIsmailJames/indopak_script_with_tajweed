We have divided the quran into parts for both indopak_script and qpc_hafs_tajweed
that includes all tajweed rules in it as json files. But the indopak_script has no
tajweed rules in it. So we have to add tajweed rules to it.

out goal is to follow the qpc_hafs_tajweed as close as possible. then implements
the indopak_script with tajweed rules. Look the script is different but the rules
apply same as qpc_hafs_tajweed. We need to make it fit them properly.

for reference we have tajweed rules markdown file.

we will touch parts by parts and make it fit them properly.
